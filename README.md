# RESTy-API

4 phase React application.  
phase 1: Basic Scaffolding
phase 2: Adding State
phase 3: Component Lifecycle

## Lab Requirements

Phase 1: Set-up

- In this first phase, our goal is to setup the basic scaffolding of the application, with intent being to add more functionality to the system as we go. This initial build sets up the file structure so that we can progressively build this application in a scalable manner  

Phase 2: useState() Hook

- In phase 2, we will be receiving user input in preparation of connecting to live APIs, using the useState() hook in our functional components. The following user stories detail the major functionality for this phase of the project.
  - As a user, I want to enter the REST Method and URL to an API
  - As a user, I want to see a summary of my request as well as results returned from an API request in my browser in a readable format

Phase 3: Component Lifecycle / useEffect() Hook  

- In phase 3, we will be connecting RESTy to live APIs, fetching and displaying remote data. Our primary focus will be to service GET requests.The following user stories detail the major functionality for this phase of the project.  
  - As a user, I want to enter the URL to an API and issue a GET request so that I can retrieve itâ€™s data  
  - As a user, I want to see the results returned from an API request in my browser in a readable format
